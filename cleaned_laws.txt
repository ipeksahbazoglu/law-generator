Cartoon Laws\
Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its situation. Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland. He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to look down. At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per second per second takes over.\
Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter intervenes suddenly. Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon characters are so absolute in their momentum that only a telephone pole or an outsize boulder retards their forward motion absolutely. Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the stooge's surcease.\
Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to its perimeter. Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout- perfect hole. The threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction.\
The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken. Such an object is inevitably priceless, the attempt to capture it inevitably unsuccessful.\
All principles of gravity are negated by fear. Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them directly away from the earth's surface. A spooky noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to the cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole. The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.\
As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once. This is particularly true of tooth-and-claw fights, in which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of altercation at several places simultaneously. This effect is common as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled. A 'wacky' character has the option of self- replication only at manic high speeds and may ricochet off walls to achieve the velocity required.\
Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel entrances; others cannot. This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generation, but at least it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall's surface to trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical space. The painter is flattened against the wall when he attempts to follow into the painting. This is ultimately a problem of art, not of science.\
Any violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent. Cartoon cats possess even more deaths than the traditional nine lives might comfortably afford. They can be decimated, spliced, splayed, accordion-pleated, spindled, or disassembled, but they cannot be destroyed. After a few moments of blinking self pity, they reinflate, elongate, snap back, or solidify.\

Extended Epstein-Heisenberg Principle: In an R & D orbit, only 2 of the existing 3 parameters can be defined simultaneously. The parameters are: task, time, and resources ($). 1) If one knows what the task is, and there is a time limit allowed for the completion of the task, then one cannot guess how much it will cost. 2) If the time and resources ($) are clearly defined, then it is impossible to know what part of the R & D task will be performed. 3) If you are given a clearly defined R & D goal and a definte amount of money which has been calculated to be necessary for the completion of the task, one cannot predict if and when the goal will be reached. 4) If one is lucky enough to be able to accurately define all three parameters, then what one is dealing with is not in the realm of R & D.\
Epstein's Law: If you think the problem is bad now, just wait until we've solved it.\
Ettorre's Observation: The other line moves faster.\
Corollary: Don't try to change lines. The other line -- the one you were in originally -- will then move faster.\
Evans's Law of Politics: When team members are finally in a position to help the team, it turns out they have quit the team.\
Evelyn's Rules for Bureaucratic Survival:\
A bureaucrat's castle is his desk . . . and parking place. Proceed cautiously when changing either.\
On the theory that one should never take anything for granted, follow up on everything, but especially those items varying from the norm. The greater the divergence from normal routine and/or the greater the number of offices potentially involved, the better the chance a never-to-be-discovered person will file the problem away in a drawer specifically designed for items requiring a decision.\
Never say without qualification that your activity has sufficient space, money, staff, etc.\
Always distrust offices not under your jurisdiction which say that they are there to serve you. "Support" offices in a bureaucracy tend to grow in size and make demands on you out of proportion to their service, and in the end require more effort on your part than their service is worth.\
Corollary: Support organizations can always prove success by showing service to someone . . . not necessarily you.\
Incompetents often hire able assistants.\
Everitt's Form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Confusion (entropy) is always increasing in society.

The information you have is not what you want.\
The information you want is not what you need.\
The information you need is not what you can obtain.\
The information you can obtain costs more than you want to pay.\
Finagle's Rules: Ever since the first scientific experiment, man has been plagued by the increasing antagonism of nature. It seems only right that nature should be logical and neat, but experience has shown that this is not the case. A further series of rules has been formulated, designed to help man accept the pigheadedness of nature.\
To study a subject best, understand it thoroughly before you start.\
Always keep a record of data. It indicates you've been working.\
Always draw your curves, then plot the reading.\
In case of doubt, make it sound convincing.\
Experiments should be reproducible. They should all fail in the same way.\

Laws of the Frisbee:\
The most powerful force in the world is that of a disc straining to land under a car, just beyond reach. (The technical term for this force is "car suck".)\
The higher the quality of a catch or the comment it receives, the greater the probability of a crummy return throw. ("Good catch. . . Bad throw.")\
One must never precede any maneuver by a comment more predictive than, "Watch this!" (Keep 'em guessing.)\
The higher the costs of hitting any object, the greater the certainty it will be struck. (Remember: The disk is positive; cops and old ladies are clearly negative.)\
The best catches are never seen. ("Did you see that?" "See what?")\
The greatest single aid to distance is for the disc to be going in a direction you did not want. (Wrong way = long way.)\
The most powerful hex words in the sport are: "I really have this down -- watch." (Know it? Blow it!)\
In any crowd of spectators at least one will suggest that razor blades could be attached to the disc. ("You could maim and kill with that thing.")\
The greater your need to make a good catch, the greater the probability your partner will deliver his worst throw. (If you can't touch it, you can't trick it.)\
The single most difficult move with a disc is to put it down. ("Just one more!")\
Frisch's Law: You cannot have a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\

Getty's Reminder: The meek shall inherit the earth, but NOT its mineral rights.\
Gibb's Law: Infinity is one lawyer waiting for another.\
Gilb's Laws of Unreliability (see also Troutman's Laws of Computer Programming):\
Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable.\
Corollary: At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer you will find at least two human errors, including the error of blaming it on the computer.\
Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable.\
The only difference between the fool and the criminal who attacks a system is that the fool attacks unpredictably and on a broader front.\
A system tends to grow in terms of complexity rather than of simplification, until the resulting unreliability becomes intolerable.\
Self-checking systems tend to have a complexity in proportion to the inherent unreliability of the system in which they are used.\
The error-detection and correction capabilities of any system will serve as the key to understanding the type of errors which they cannot handle.\
Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.\
All real programs contain errors until proved otherwise -- which is impossible.\
Investment in reliability will increase until it exceeds the probable cost of errors, or somebody insists on getting some useful work done.\
Gilmer's Motto for Political Leadership: Look over your shoulder now and then to be sure someone's following you.\
Ginsberg's Theorem (Generalized Laws of Thermodynamics):\
You can't win.\
You can't break even.\
You can't even quit the game.\
Ehrman's Commentary on Ginberg's Theorem:\
Things will get worse before they get better.\
Who said things would get better?\
Freeman's Commentary on Ginberg's Theorem: Every major philosophy that attempts to make life seem meaningful is based on the negation of one part of Ginsberg's Theorem. To wit:\
Capitalism is based on the assumption that you can win.\
Socialism is based on the assumption that you can break even.\
Mysticism is based on the assumption that you can quit the game.\

Gordon's First Law: If a research project is not worth doing, it is not worth doing well.\
Professor Gordon's Rule of Evolving Bryophytic Systems: While bryophytic plants are typically encountered in substrata of earthy or mineral matter in concreted state, discrete substrata elements occasionally display a roughly spherical configuration which, in presence of suitable gravitational and other effects, lends itself to combined translatory and rotational motion. One notices in such cases an absence of the otherwise typical accretion of bryophyta. We conclude therefore that a rolling stone gathers no moss.\
Corollary (Rutgers): Generally the subjective value assignable to avian lifeforms, when encountered and considered within the confines of certain orders of woody plants lacking true meristematic dominance, as compared to a possible valuation of these same lifeforms when in the grasp of -- and subject to control by -- the manipulative bone/muscle/nerve complex typically terminating the forelimb of a member of the species homo sapiens (and possibly direct precursors thereof) is approximately five times ten to the minus first power.\

Kamin's Seventh Law: Politicians will always inflate when given the opportunity.\
Kaplan's Law of the Instrument: Give a small boy a hammer and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding.\
Katz's Law: Men and nations will act rationally when all other possibilities have been exhausted.\
Katz's Maxims:\
Where are the calculations that go with the calculated risk?\
Inventing is easy for staff outfits. Stating a problem is much harder. Instead of stating problems, people like to pass out half- accurate statements together with half-available solutions which they can't finish and which they want you to finish.\
Every organization is self-perpetuating. Don't ever ask an outfit to justify itself, or you'll be covered with facts, figures, and fancy. The criterion should rather be, "What will happen if the outfit stops doing what it's doing?" The value of an organization is more easily determined this way.\
Try to find out who's doing the work, not who's writing about it, controlling it, or summarizing it.\
Watch out for formal briefings; they often produce an avalanche (a high-level snow job of massive and overwhelming proportions).\
The difficulty of the coordination task often blinds one to the fact that a fully coordinated piece of paper is not supposed to be either the major or the final product of the organization, but it often turns out that way.\
Most organizations can't hold more than one idea at a time. Thus complementary ideas are always regarded as competetive. Further, like a quantized pendulum, an organization can jump from one extreme to the other, without ever going through the middle.\
Try to find the real tense of the report you are reading: Was it done, is it being done, or is it something to be done? Reports are now written in four tenses: past tense, present tense, future tense, and pretense. Watch for novel uses of "contractor grammar", defined by the imperfect past, the insufficient present, and the absolutely perfect future.\

If you want to kill any idea in the world today, get a committee working on it.\
If you have always done it that way, it is probably wrong.\
Key to Status: S = D/K. S is the status of a person in an organization, D is the number of doors he must open to perform his job, and K is the number of keys he carries. A higher number denotes higher status. Thus the janitor needs to open 20 doors and has 20 keys (S = 1), a secretary has to open two doors with one key (S = 2), but the president never has to carry any keys since there is always someone around to open doors for him (with K = 0 and a high D, his S reaches infinity).\

Levy's Ten Laws of the Disillusionment of the True Liberal:\
Large numbers of things are determined, and therefore not subject to change.\
Anticipated events never live up to expectations.\
That segment of the community with which one has the greatest sympathy as a liberal inevitably turns out to be one of the most narrow-minded and bigoted segments of the community.\
Always pray that your opposition be wicked. In wickedness there is a strong strain toward rationality. Therefore there is always the possibility, in theory, of handling the wicked by outthinking them.\
Corollary 1: Good intentions randomize behavior.\
Corollary 2: Good intentions are far more difficult to cope with than malicious intent.\
Corollary 3: If good intentions are combined with stupidity, it is impossible to outthink them.\

Long's Notes:\
Always store beer in a dark place.\
Certainly the game is rigged. Don't let that stop you; if you don't bet, you can't win.\
Any priest or shaman must be presumed guilty until proved innocent.\
Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it.\
If it can't be expressed in figures, it is not science; it is opinion.\
It has long been known that one horse can run faster than another -- but which one? Differences are crucial.\
A fake fortuneteller can be tolerated. But an authentic soothsayer should be shot on sight. Cassandra did not get half the kicking around she deserved.\
Delusions are often functional. A mother's opinions about her children's beauty, intelligence, goodness, et cetera ad nauseam, keep her from drowning them at birth.\
A generation which ignores history has no past -- and no future.\
A poet who reads his verse in public may have other nasty habits.\
Small change can often be found under seat cushions.\
History does not record anywhere at any time a religion that has any rational basis. Religion is a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up to the unknown without help. But, like dandruff, most people do have a religion and spend time and money on it and seem to derive considerable pleasure from fiddling with it.\
It's amazing how much "mature wisdom" resembles being too tired.\
Of all the strange "crimes" that human beings have legislated out of nothing, "blasphemy" is the most amazing -- with "obscenity" and "indecent exposure" fighting it out for second and third place.\
It's better to copulate than never.\
Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks.\
It may be better to be a live jackal than a dead lion, but it is better still to be a live lion. And usually easier.\

An elephant: A mouse built to government specifications.\
A zygote is a gamete's way of producing more gametes. This may be the purpose of the universe.\
Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or by legislation. Stupidity is not a sin; the victim can't help being stupid. But stupidity is the only universal capital crime; the sentence is death, there is no appeal, and execution is carried out automatically and without pity.\
God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. It says so right here on the label. If you have a mind capable of believing all three of these divine attributes simultaneously, I have a wonderful bargain for you. No checks, please. Cash and in small bills.\
Beware of altruism. It is based on self-deception, the root of all evil.\
Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.\

Expertise in one field does not carry over into other fields. But experts often think so. The narrower their field of knowledge the more likely they are to think so.\
Never try to outstubborn a cat.\
Tilting at windmills hurts you more than the windmills.\
Yield to temptation; it may not pass your way again.\
Waking a person unnecessarily should not be considered a capital crime. For a first offense, that is.\
The correct way to punctuate a sentence that starts: "Of course it's none of my business, but . . . " is to place a period after the word "but". Don't use excessive force in supplying such a moron with a period. Cutting his throat is only a momentary pleasure and is bound to get you talked about.\
A skunk is better company than a person who prides himself on being "frank".\
Natural laws have no pity.\
You can go wrong by being too skeptical as readily as by being too trusting.\
Anything free is worth what you pay for it.\
Climate is what we expect; weather is what we get.\
Pessimist by policy, optimist by temperament -- it is possible to be both. How? By never taking an unnecessary chance and by minimizing risks you can't avoid. This permits you to play out the game happily, untroubled by the certainty of the outcome.\

Law of Probable Dispersal: Whatever hits the fan will not be evenly distributed. (also known as the How Come It All Landed On Me Law)\
Laws of Procrastination:\
Procrastination shortens the job and places the responsibility for its termination on someone else (the authority who imposed the deadline).\
It reduces anxiety by reducing the expected quality of the project from the best of all possible efforts to the best that can be expected given the limited time.\
Status is gained in the eyes of others, and in one's own eyes, because it is assumed that the importance of the work justifies the stress.\
Avoidance of interruptions including the assignment of other duties can be achieved, so that the obviously stressed worker can concentrate on the single effort.\

White's Observations of Committee Operation:\
People very rarely think in groups; they talk together, they exchange information, they adjudicate, they make compromises. But they do not think; they do not create.\
A really new idea affronts current agreement.\
A meeting cannot be productive unless certain premises are so shared that they do not need to be discussed, and the argument can be confined to areas of disagreement. But while this kind of consensus makes a group more effective in its legitimate functions, it does not make the group a creative vehicle -- it would not be a new idea if it didn't -- and the group, impelled as it is to agree, is instinctively hostile to that which is divisive.\
